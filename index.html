        <h1>Different types of selectors <span id="latest">New</span></h1>
        <h2>1- Element Selectors:</h2>
        <p>The element selector allows developers to select HTML elements based on their element type.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>2- ID Selectors:</h2>
        <p>The ID selector uses the id attribute of an HTML.<br>
        Since the id is unique within a webpage, it allows the developer to select a specific element for styling.<br> 
        ID selectors are prefixed with a # character.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>3- Class Selectors:</h2>
        <p>Elements can also be selected based on the class attribute applied to them.<br> 
        The CSS rule has been applied to all elements with the specified class name.<br> 
        The class selector is prefixed with a . character.</p>

        <h2>6- Child Selectors <span id="new">( Important ) !!!</span></h2>
        <p>Child selectors are more specific than descendant selectors.<br> 
            They only select elements that are immediate descendants (children) of a selector (the parent).</p>

            <p>This will select the element with the ID blog (the parent),<br> 
                then it will select all h1 elements that are contained directly in that element (the children).<br> 
                The structure of the child selector is a CSS selector followed by the child combinator symbol > followed by another CSS selector.</p>
            <p>Note that this will not go beyond a single depth level. Therefore, <br>
                the CSS rule will not be applied to the h1 element containing the text Today's Weather.</p>

        <h2>7- :hover Pseudo-Class</h2>
        <p>The simplest example of this is changing the color of a hyperlink when it is hovered over. <br>
            To do this, you add the :hover pseudo-class to the end of the selector. In the following example, <br>
            adding :hover  to the a element will change the color of the hyperlink to orange when it is hovered over.</p>
